//! Streaming large result sets from PostgreSQL with bsql.
//!
//! Demonstrates: stream (also available as fetch_stream) for row-by-row
//! processing without loading the entire result set into memory.
//!
//! Uses PostgreSQL's portal / extended query protocol to stream rows
//! in batches. Each row is decoded and processed before the next batch
//! is fetched, keeping memory usage constant regardless of result size.
//!
//! Requires a PostgreSQL instance with:
//!   CREATE TABLE events (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, kind TEXT NOT NULL, payload TEXT, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now());
//!
//! Run:
//!   BSQL_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost/mydb cargo run --bin pg_streaming
