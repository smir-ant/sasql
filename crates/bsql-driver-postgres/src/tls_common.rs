//! Shared rustls primitives used by both sync and async TLS paths.
//!
//! # Central invariant
//!
//! bsql hard-pins `ring` as the rustls crypto provider and passes it
//! explicitly to every `ClientConfig::builder_with_provider` call. This
//! bypasses rustls 0.23's process-level `CryptoProvider` auto-selection,
//! which panics at runtime when cargo feature unification pulls in BOTH
//! `ring` and `aws-lc-rs` (for example, when a user's project depends on
//! `reqwest` with `rustls-tls-native-roots` alongside bsql's `ring`), or
//! when neither is enabled.
//!
//! The panic this module replaces lives at
//! `rustls-0.23/src/crypto/mod.rs:249` —
//!
//! > "Could not automatically determine the process-level CryptoProvider
//! > from Rustls crate features. Call `CryptoProvider::install_default()`
//! > before this point to select a provider manually, or make sure
//! > exactly one of the `aws-lc-rs` and `ring` features is enabled."
//!
//! That panic is only reachable through the zero-argument
//! `ClientConfig::builder()` constructor. The
//! `builder_with_provider(provider)` constructor takes an explicit
//! provider and never touches the process-level state, so it cannot
//! reach `get_default_or_install_from_crate_features`. `builder()` is
//! forbidden in this crate: every TLS config is built via
//! [`build_client_config`] below.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! - **Hot path (per-connection TLS handshake)**: zero allocations for
//!   the crypto provider. `ring_provider()` clones a cached `Arc` — an
//!   atomic refcount bump.
//! - **Cold path (first TLS setup in the process)**: exactly one
//!   `Arc::new(CryptoProvider)` allocation for the process lifetime.
//! - **Default `ClientConfig`**: also cached, one `Arc<ClientConfig>`
//!   allocation total, shared between sync and async paths.
//! - **Custom `ClientConfig`** (`ssl_root_cert`/`ssl_cert`/`ssl_key`):
//!   built once per pool that requests it, reuses the shared provider.
