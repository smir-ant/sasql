//! Database transactions with commit/rollback and drop-guard semantics.
//!
//! Created via [`Pool::begin()`](crate::pool::Pool::begin). A transaction
//! holds a single connection from the pool for its entire lifetime. Queries
//! executed through the `Executor` trait run within the transaction.
//!
//! # Drop behavior
//!
//! If a `Transaction` is dropped without calling [`commit()`](Transaction::commit)
//! or [`rollback()`](Transaction::rollback), the connection is permanently detached
//! from the pool via `Object::take()` and closed. A warning is logged to stderr.
//! `Drop` is synchronous and cannot send an async `ROLLBACK`, so the connection
//! must be discarded to prevent reuse in a dirty state.
//!
//! Always call `commit()` or `rollback()` explicitly.
